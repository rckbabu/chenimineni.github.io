        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a Certified Independent Director registered with the Indian Institute of Corporate Affairs
            (Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India), with over 20 years of experience in the
            IT and Financial Services industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have led enterprise-scale financial systems across Private Equity, Mutual Funds, and
            Securitization, delivering compliant, scalable, and mission-critical platforms for global
            investment operations.
        </p>
        <p>
            My current focus is contributing at the Board and Advisory level, supporting organizations
            in governance, digital transformation, risk oversight, ESG, and technology strategy.
